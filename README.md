NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN AI POWERED ASSISTANT(yet) IT CAN ONLY BE USED FOR MANUAL DATA ENTRY

Data analysis is extremely fun(I assume I've only done cool project no work experience yet) but gathering data can sometimes be a pain, for previous projects I have had to scrape websites and google search results(image data) to make my datasets, however sometimes people need to manually create datasets which sounds like an awful process going from and to excel to enter your data or split screen it. 

HERE IS YOUR SOLUTION!!

STEP 1: This extension takes an excel file as an input but before uploading the excel file make columns for each parameter/field you will need to gather data for, then upload it to the extension

STEP 2: Click "Start Session" to start the data gathering session, now this form will be available regardless of which site/tab you go to until you end the session.

STEP 3: Enter data into the form's fields and click submit this adds a row to the excel file with all the data, keep doing this until you are satisfied with the amount of data you have collected.

STEP 4: Once you are done with gathering your data simply click end session, this will output an excel file with the data that you have previously collected and delete all the information stored by the extension

STEP 5: Repeat for the next dataset# Data-Entry-Assistant
